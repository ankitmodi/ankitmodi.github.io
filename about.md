Hey,

I'm Ankit Modi - currently residing in Mumbai, India.

My professional interests lie at the junction of healthcare and technology. I am a founding member & Product Manager at [Qure.ai](https://qure.ai/). I'm working on building experiences that integrate AI seamlessly with radiology.

My hobbies are reading, writing, cricket, football & music - in that order.

I agree that Sachin Tendulkar, Lionel Messi & Roger Federer are the best in Cricket, Football & Tennis respectively. Still, my fandom belongs to Rahul Dravid, Cristiano Ronaldo & Rafael Nadal. Can't help it!

If you're a Rahul Dravid fan, then we should hang out soon. If you are also into Stoic philosophy and writings, then weâ€™re best friends already.
